# Fixture Testing Implementation

## Overview

This document summarizes the comprehensive fixture-based testing implementation for the Liquid Language Server, covering all template types and include scenarios.

## Completed Tasks

### 1. Fixture Repository Integration

- ✅ Examined the `fixtures/market-repo/` structure added in commit `d1d08d3`
- ✅ Identified all template types: Account Templates (AT), Reconciliation Texts (RT), Export Files (EF), and Shared Parts (SP)
- ✅ Analyzed include patterns and translation definition structures

### 2. Documentation Updates

- ✅ Updated `CLAUDE.md` with new terminology:
  - **RT**: Reconciliation Text (reconciliation_texts/)
  - **AT**: Account Template (account_templates/)
  - **EF**: Export File (export_files/)
  - **SP**: Shared Parts (shared_parts/)
  - **Templates**: Collective term for RT, AT, and EF
- ✅ Added fixture documentation and usage guidelines

### 3. Comprehensive Test Suite

- ✅ Created `test/fixtures-integration.test.ts` with 33 comprehensive tests
- ✅ Covered all template types (AT, RT, EF) for both hover and go-to-definition functionality
- ✅ Tested include scenarios:
  - Parts included in main templates
  - Parts included in other parts (nested includes)
- ✅ Added scope-aware behavior tests:
  - Include statement after translation tag (out of scope)
  - No include statement (translation not available)
  - Scope boundary verification
- ✅ Added config.json path resolution tests:
  - Custom paths defined in config.json are correctly used
  - Verification that inference is not used when config.json exists
- ✅ Added include go-to-definition tests:
  - Navigate from main templates to included parts
  - Navigate from parts to other parts (nested includes)
  - Custom config.json path resolution for includes
  - Error handling for non-existent includes
- ✅ Added cross-template consistency tests
- ✅ Included edge cases and error handling tests

### 4. Implementation Fixes & New Features

- ✅ **Added include go-to-definition**: Navigate from `{% include 'parts/name' %}` to the included file
- ✅ **Fixed config.json path resolution**: `ScopeAwareProvider` now uses config.json mappings instead of inferring paths
- ✅ **Cleaned up hover behavior**: Removed debug node information display, now only shows hover for translation tags
- ✅ Corrected `ScopeAwareProvider.resolveIncludePath()` to handle only `parts/` prefix (plural)
- ✅ Made name resolution flexible for any string after `parts/` (not just specific patterns)
- ✅ Updated all fixture files to use correct `parts/` syntax
- ✅ Fixed AT fixture to include proper nested include structure
- ✅ All 122 tests now pass (100% success rate)

## Test Coverage

### Template Types Tested

1. **Account Templates (AT)**
   - Translation hover in main.liquid
   - Go-to-definition from main to parts
   - Nested include scenarios (part_1 → part_2)

2. **Reconciliation Texts (RT)**
   - Translation hover in main.liquid
   - Go-to-definition from main to parts
   - Complex nested include scenarios

3. **Export Files (EF)**
   - Translation hover in main.liquid
   - Go-to-definition from main to parts
   - Handling of empty part files

### Include Scenarios Covered

- ✅ **Part included in main**: `main.liquid` includes `part_1.liquid`
- ✅ **Part included in another part**: `part_1.liquid` includes `part_2.liquid`
- ✅ **Nested resolution**: Translation calls in main find definitions through nested includes
- ✅ **Scope-aware behavior**: Only translations "in scope" are found

### Scope-Aware Behavior Tested

- ✅ **Include after translation**: Translation calls before include statements don't find definitions
- ✅ **No include statements**: Translation calls with no includes don't find definitions
- ✅ **Scope boundaries**: Same file behaves differently based on cursor position relative to includes
- ✅ **Positive verification**: Include before translation correctly finds definitions

### Config.json Path Resolution Tested

- ✅ **Custom paths**: Templates with non-standard directory structures defined in config.json
- ✅ **Config precedence**: config.json mappings take precedence over inferred paths
- ✅ **Fallback behavior**: Standard directory structure used when config.json mapping not found

### Edge Cases Tested

- ✅ Templates without text_parts
- ✅ Malformed config.json handling
- ✅ Empty translation definition files
- ✅ Missing translation definitions
- ✅ Cross-template type consistency

## Key Implementation Insights

### Include Path Resolution

The implementation now correctly uses config.json mappings:

- **Config-based**: `'parts/part_1'` → looks up `"part_1"` in config.json `text_parts` → resolves to actual path
- **Example**: `"part_1": "text_parts/part_1.liquid"` → `text_parts/part_1.liquid`
- **Custom paths**: `"custom_part": "custom_directory/my_custom_part.liquid"` → `custom_directory/my_custom_part.liquid`
- **Fallback**: If no config.json mapping found, falls back to standard `text_parts/` directory structure

### Scope-Aware Translation Lookup

The implementation correctly handles:

1. **Execution Order**: Processes includes in the order they appear
2. **Nested Includes**: Recursively processes includes within included files
3. **Line-Based Scope**: Only considers translations defined before cursor position
4. **Circular Protection**: Prevents infinite loops in circular includes

### Translation Definition Structure

All fixtures follow the pattern:

```liquid
{% t="key" default:"English" es:"Spanish" %}
```

## Test Results

- **Total Tests**: 122
- **Passing Tests**: 122 (100%)
- **Test Suites**: 8 (all passing)
- **Coverage**: All template types, include scenarios, scope-aware behavior, config.json path resolution, include go-to-definition, and edge cases

## Files Modified

2. `src/scopeAwareProvider.ts` - **Fixed to use config.json path mappings instead of inference**
3. `src/hoverHandler.ts` - **Cleaned up to only show hover for translation tags (removed debug node info)**
4. `src/treeSitterLiquidProvider.ts` - **Added include statement detection (`getIncludePathAtPosition`)**
5. `src/definitionHandler.ts` - **Added include go-to-definition functionality**
6. `fixtures/market-repo/account_templates/account_1/text_parts/part_1.liquid` - Added nested include

9. `fixtures/market-repo/account_templates/account_3/main.liquid` - Added no-include test case
10. `fixtures/market-repo/account_templates/account_3/text_parts/part_1.liquid` - Added translation definition for no-include test
11. `fixtures/market-repo/account_templates/account_custom/` - **Added custom config.json path test case**
12. `test/hoverHandler.test.ts` - Updated test to expect null for non-translation content
13. `test/definitionHandler.test.ts` - Updated mocks to include new include detection method

15. `test/fixtures-integration.test.ts` - **Comprehensive test suite with include go-to-definition tests**

## Quality Assurance

- ✅ All tests pass
- ✅ ESLint passes with no errors
- ✅ Prettier formatting applied
- ✅ TypeScript compilation successful
- ✅ No breaking changes to existing functionality

## Future Enhancements

The fixture-based testing foundation is now ready for:

1. **Shared Parts (SP) testing** when SP functionality is implemented
2. **Additional template types** as they are added
3. **Complex include scenarios** with multiple nesting levels
4. **Performance testing** with large fixture repositories

This comprehensive testing implementation ensures robust functionality across all Silverfin template types and include scenarios.
